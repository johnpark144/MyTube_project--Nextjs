YouTube Data API, YouTube rapidApi, PhotoShop
- YouTube Data API (https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/), YouTube rapidApi(https://rapidapi.com/ytdlfree/api/youtube-v31/)
- Explantion : I have learned some useful skills to develop web sites such as Next JS, Redux, Reactquery, Darkmode, TypeScript etc. 
I just wanted to practice all I learned by building this website, since I focused on skills, It would be way different from regular YouTube website so I want to say it is MyTube, and also by building that, I actually realized that some website like this doesn't fit with Server-Side-Renderling(SSR) but good enough with just React, so Building this website was the very instructive time to learn about deference between SSR, CSR, and even SSG, as well as skills that I learn

# Ps, FYI
- In the middle of building this project, I found some similar tutorial lecture from Youtube building Youtube clone only using React not even NextJS.
It's true that I refer to how the outcome of this tutorial looks like in the end of that video,
but I didn't even watch that lecture at all other than ending part. so the code and the way to implement will be totally deferent.
- Due to limited call of API, I decided to use 2 of similar Youtube APIs so the number of calling API has been distributed.
