# Ps, FYI
- In the middle of building this project, I found some similar tutorial lecture from Youtube building Youtube clone only using React.
It's true that I refer to how the outcome of this tutorial looks like in the end of that video,
but I didn't even watch that lecture at all other than ending part. so code and the way to implement will be totally deferent.
- Due to limited call of API, I decided to use 2 of similar Youtube APIs so the number of calling API has been distributed.
